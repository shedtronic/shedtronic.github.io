This is a project to create a hub for all github projects by @shedtronic

There isn't much here yet, just playing around with bootstrap and glitch text but I will be starting some projects really soon. 

I have decided that the home page should be dedicated to CEEFAX, the pre internet pages served on 1980s television on your remote control. Why? Who knows where this may lead.

Now set up with slow navigation and some placeholder content. If you click the toggle for the slow navigation, the page takes ages to go to the next page and you have to wait. Brilliant!
